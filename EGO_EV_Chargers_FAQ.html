            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How quickly will my EV charge with the Ego EV Charger?</h3>
                <p>Naturally, charging speed depends on a number of factors. These include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>EV battery capacity</li>
                    <li>Power output from the charger to the EV</li>
                </ul>
                <p>With a standard home single-phase (230V) power supply, the user can expect a maximum power output of 7.2kW. A commercial 3-phase power supply can supply a much greater maximum of 22kW of power. Naturally, this means that the 3-phase supplied charger will be much quicker. However, the single-phase charger is more than adequate for home charging.</p>
                <p>The below table displays estimated charging times for a full charge for a pair of EVs with different battery sizes given a single-phase or 3-phase power input.</p>
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
